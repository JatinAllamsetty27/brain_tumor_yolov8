## Brain Tumor Detection using YOLOv8 Model

This repository contains instructions for training a YOLOv8 model to detect brain tumors in medical images. The dataset for this project is randomly downloaded from the browser using `download_images.py` and later labeled using the `labelImg` tool.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system.
- [YOLOv8 repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) cloned to your local machine.
- [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) installed for labeling the images.

### Dataset Preparation

1. Download the dataset of medical images containing brain scans with and without tumors. You can do this using the `download_images.py` script.

2. Label the downloaded images to indicate the location and boundaries of the tumors using the `labelImg` tool. This step is crucial for training the YOLOv8 model.

### Model Training

1. Go to the YOLOv8 repository directory that you cloned earlier.

2. Train the YOLOv8 model on the labeled brain tumor dataset. You can use the following command:

   ```bash
   python train.py --data path/to/your/data.yaml --cfg path/to/your/yolov8-config.yaml --weights yolov8.weights
   ```

   Replace `path/to/your/data.yaml` with the path to your dataset configuration file and `path/to/your/yolov8-config.yaml` with the path to your YOLOv8 configuration file. You can also specify the pre-trained weights you want to use with the `--weights` option.

3. During training, monitor the model's performance and loss on the training and validation sets to ensure it's learning correctly and not overfitting.

### Testing

1. Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance on a separate test dataset to assess its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

### Post-processing and Visualization

After obtaining predictions from the model, you may need to post-process the results to filter out false positives and refine the tumor boundaries. Visualize the results by overlaying bounding boxes or contours on the original medical images to show the detected tumors.

### Performance Metrics

Calculate performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to assess the model's accuracy in detecting brain tumors.

### Deployment

If the model performs well, you can deploy it for real-world use. This may involve integrating it into a medical imaging system or application for radiologists and doctors to use in clinical practice.
